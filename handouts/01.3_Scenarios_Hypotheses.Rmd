Below are 5 practice problems. For each problem, write the hypotheses (null and alternative) in symbols. Choose one problem to work to completion (simulating using the applet), finding the p-value and standardized statistic, interpreting each statistic, and stating the conclusion to the research problem. Do the p-value and standardized statistic agree?

1. A governor is concerned about his "negatives" - the percentage of the state's residents who express disapproval of his job performance. His political committee pays for a series of TV ads, hoping that they can keep the negatives below 30%. They will use follow-up polling to assess the effectiveness of the ad campaign. After the campaign, 337 out of 1200 residents surveyed expressed disapproval.
