# 4.1: Association and Confounding


---

## Introduction: Association vs. Causation

- Association (correlation): Two variables are associated, or related, if the value of one variable gives you information about the value of the other variable.

  - When comparing groups, this means that the proportions or means take on different values in the different groups.
  
  - Or as one variable decreases, the other variable may decrease too. We'll see other examples in chapter 10. 

---

## We Record Two Variables Now  
- Explanatory Variable(s): variable(s) that may explain the change in the variable of interest.
  - Called the independent variable. 

- Response Variable(s): variable(s) of interest we measure  on observational units.

  - Called the dependent variable. 

  - Chapter 1 and 2, we did hypothesis tests about the response variable. In chapter 3, we estimated the response variable. 
   
- We hope that changes in the explanatory variable will affect the response variable =&gt; **cause-and-effect** relationship

 - **End goal** = find cause-and-effect relationships
 
---

## Association vs. Causation

- Often in scientific studies, we see associations.

- Association, alone, is not enough to prove cause-and-effect relationships exist.

## Try to Explain This Association

- For example, try to explain to your group how this association could be a cause-and-effect relationship.

## Why Can't Associations Determine Cause-And-Effect?

- Confounding Variable(s) affect both the explanatory and response variables enough to make cause-and-effect impossible to determine.

  - These are other variables that you may not know about, or aren't measured in your study. 
  - What are possible confounding variables in the association between ice cream sales and shark attacks?

# 4.2: Observational Studies Vs. Experiments


---

## Observational Study

- The values of the explanatory variable are simply observed. Researchers cannot change or assign them to observational units. Examples are: 

  - Does your child sleep with a night light? 
  - Which NBA team does a player play for? 
  - Which country were you born in? 
  - An animal's gender
  - Number of social media profiles
  - Amount of video games a person owns
  - Commute to work in minutes

---

## Experiment

- Researchers can assign the values of the explanatory variable to observational units. 

  - In experiments, we can say observational units are called experimental units
  
- Examples:

  - Treatment vs. Control (do nothing or give a placebo)
  - Did you use the internet to play a game or pencil and paper?
  - Amount of days a plant doesn't have any water
  
---

## Setting Up a Good Experiment

- We want to avoid two things:

  - **Sampling Bias **
  - **Confounding Variables**
  
We use two strategies in STAT 218

- Simple Random Sampling


- Random Assignment: Use a random/chance device to assign values of the explanatory variable to experimental units
    - Randomly assign groups (categorical explanatory variable)
    - Randomly assign a measurement (quantitative explanatory variable)
    
---
## Random Sampling and Random Assignment

- You can use neither, one of them, or both to do your experiment.

## Example and Benefits

- I need some random students from the class...

- I will randomly assign them a group

- Benefits:
  - Random sampling gets rid of sampling bias. We can **generalize our conclusions** to the whole population.
  - Random assignment removes the effect of confounding variables. We can determine **cause-and-effect** if we have enough evidence to reject `\(H_0\)`. 
  
---

## Types of Experiments

- No random assignment

  - quasi-experiment
  
- Random assignment

  - randomized experiment

- Random assignment and neither the researcher or experimental unit know what group or measurement they have

  - double-blind experiment

## Answer These Questions with your Group
Suppose you want to measure the average daily weight gain of steers. You assigned each steer dry-rolled corn or wet (fermented) corn. Then, you measured their average daily weight gain. You gathered a sample of 60 steers. 

- What is the explanatory variable?

- What is the response variable? 

- How could you gather a random sample of steers? 

- How would you do random assignment in this study?

- Can you identify a confounding variable?
