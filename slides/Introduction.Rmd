If you have a disability (or suspect you have a disabilty), you can work with Services for Students with Disabilities to get accommodations to support you. Disabilities might include ADHD, sensory processing disorders, depression, chronic illness, migraines, etc. in addition to physical limitations and learning disabilities. SSD will work with you to figure out what accommodations are reasonable and provide written documentation to give to your professors. 

On that note, I'd like to make you aware of a couple of my own limitations. I have prosopagnosia, which is also called face blindness; it affects my ability to recognize faces. I can see your face just fine, but it doesn't get "written to memory" properly, so I have trouble identifying people. I use cues such as haircuts and glasses, but these aren't failsafe. I will work to learn your names, but it is difficult for me, so I would ask that you remind me who you are when we talk one-on-one, and don't get offended if I walk right past you and don't wave or smile outside of class. I'm also red-green colorblind; when I create my slides I try to make them visually accessible, but if you have trouble with the course materials from a perceptual standpoint, please let me know - I'm happy to try to change things up to make them more broadly accessible.
