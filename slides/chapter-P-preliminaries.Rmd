## Steps of Statistical Investigation

1. Ask a research question (that can be addressed by collecting data)
2. Design a study and collect data
3. Explore the data (charts and graphs)
4. Draw inferences beyond the data
5. Formulate conclusions (using step 4)
6. Look back (limitations) and look ahead (new questions)

- Erupts every 35-120 minutes

## Example: Old Faithful

1. Ask a research question
--
- How long between eruptions?
- How high will th eruption be?
- ??
--
2. Design a study and collect data
- Measure time between eruptions, eruption length

---
## Example: Old Faithful

3. Explore the data

```{r, echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
data(geyser, package = "MASS")
ggplot(aes(x = waiting), data = geyser) + 
  geom_dotplot(binwidth = 1, method = "histodot", stackratio = 1.2, origin = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) + 
  scale_x_continuous("Time until next eruption (minutes)", breaks = seq(40, 120, by = 10))
```

This set of data is slightly different than the one in the book - more complete.

## Example: Old Faithful
3. Explore the data
```{r, echo = F}
geyser %>%
  mutate(Length = ifelse(geyser$duration > 3.5, "Long (>3.5 mins)", "Short (<=3.5 min)")) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = waiting)) + 
  facet_grid(Length~.) + 
  geom_dotplot(binwidth = 1, method = "histodot", stackratio = 1.2, origin = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) + 
  scale_x_continuous("Time until next eruption (minutes)", breaks = seq(40, 120, by = 10))
```
